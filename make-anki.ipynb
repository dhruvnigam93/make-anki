    "# Core Principles for Effective Flashcards\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Understand Before Memorizing\n",
    "- Master the material conceptually before creating cards\n",
    "- Anki reinforces existing understanding, not initial learning\n",
    "- Build coherent mental models before memorization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Minimum Information Principle\n",
    "- One idea per card\n",
    "- Keep cards as simple as possible\n",
    "- Benefits:\n",
    "  - Easier recall\n",
    "  - Efficient review scheduling\n",
    "  - Prevents cognitive overload\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Question-Based Formulation\n",
    "- Structure cards as specific questions\n",
    "- Questions provide better memory cues than statements\n",
    "- Promotes active recall\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Super techincal cards with objective questions\n",
    "- Focus on the technical part of the content when making cards, not opinions or philosophy\n",
    "- Avoid making coards on introductory things like what the materical covers, who the author is,etc\n",
    "- Overindex on equations, mathematical concepts, and algorithms and key ideas\n",
    "- If the content is not technical, do not make cards, or do it in a way that is testable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statement Cards\n",
    "   - Avoid term-definition pairs\n",
    "   - Use active questions instead\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Essay-Length Answers\n",
    "   - Break into multiple focused cards\n",
    "   - Keep answers concise\n",
    "   - Use keywords when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mechanical Cloze Deletions\n",
    "   - Use thoughtfully to test specific concepts\n",
    "   - Avoid overuse that promotes surface learning\n",
    "\n",
    "4. List Memorization\n",
    "   - Use mnemonics or memory techniques\n",
    "   - Break long lists into chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Multiple Choice Questions\n",
    "   - Avoid recognition-based testing\n",
    "   - Focus on active recall\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Binary Questions\n",
    "   - Skip yes/no and true/false formats\n",
    "   - Too high chance of guessing correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Card Structure Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Card Anatomy\n",
    "1. Question (Front)\n",
    "   - Clear, specific prompt\n",
    "   - Tests single concept\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Answer (Back)\n",
    "   - Concise response\n",
    "   - Clear success criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optional Context\n",
    "   - Supporting information\n",
    "   - Source references\n",
    "   - Related concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Guidelines\n",
    "- Facts: Embed in meaningful context\n",
    "- Complex Topics: Focus on relationships\n",
    "- Formulas: Include derivation context\n",
    "- Processes: Break into logical chunks\n",
    "- Create redundant cards from different angles\n",

DeepConf requires an offline warmup phase to establish the stopping threshold\", \"sfor online determination. For each new prompt, we generate Ninitreasoning traces (e.g., Ninit=\", \"16). The stopping threshold sis defined as:\", \"s=Percentile 100−η({Ct:t∈Twarmup}),\", \"where Twarmup represents all warmup traces, Ctis the confidence of trace t, and ηis the desired\", \"keeping ratio. Specifically, DeepConf-low uses top η= 10% (corresponding to the 90th percentile)\", \"and DeepConf-high uses top η= 90% (corresponding to the 10th percentile) uniformly across\", \"all settings.
